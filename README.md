# what-is-Nestjs
1. [Getting Started](#getting-started )

> Nestjs is a node.js backend framework built on top of Express with its strength in architecture.

Unlike **Express.js**, its lightweight counterpart which is unopinionated on how stuff should be structured, **Nestjs** aims to build a *testable, scalable, and maintainable* application through modularity.
